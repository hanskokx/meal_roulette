## Getting Started

This project utilizes `build_runner` to assist in code generation. Here's how you can get started:

1. Clone this repository locally
2. `cd` into the local directory where you have cloned this repository
3. Run `flutter pub get` and wait for it to complete
4. Run `flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`
5. Launch the project as normal

There is a demo video file (`demo.mp4`) available for preview. You may also download `app-release.apk` if you'd like to install it on your device without building manually.
